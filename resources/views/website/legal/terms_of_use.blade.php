            <strong>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong>
            Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to the Psychology To Go should be sent to: psychology.to.go.2019@gmail.com. After the Notice is received, you and the Psychology To Go may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and the Psychology To Go do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either party is entitled.

            <strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong>
            Arbitration shall be initiated through the Bulgarian Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.  If BAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.  The BAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at en.arbitrationcourtbg.org or by calling the BAA at +359 892 283 551  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand EUR (10,000.00 EUR) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand EUR (10,000.00 EUR) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside Bulgaria, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  If you reside outside of Bulgaria, the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Psychology To Go made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Psychology To Go will pay you the greater of the award or 500.00 EUR.  Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
